# js-project

This is the second project of the Full Stack Web Development postgraduate course. The objective of the project is to use the knowledge learned in class about JavaScript. In my case I have decided to develop this knowledge by programming a web page, so I have also used HTML and CSS. The website that I have developed is the continuation of the first project, which is nothing less than a clone of the Zalando sales website (zalando.es), adapted to my parents' fabric store.
